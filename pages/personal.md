Yes, you should think about what you're doing, obviously. Don't just type random gibberish as fast as you can on the screen, unless you're a Perl programmer.

## Programming Rules by me
1. First plan -> then code
1.1 Define all data definitions and transforamtions
1.2 Think of fucntions you need
2. Use IDE/text-editor that you like, not the 'cool' one
3. Have git, commit often
4. Solve one thing at a time
5. Test with each code update
6. Write tests before you write code
7. Only comment out when debugging, never delete
8. Make each function do one thing only (share responsibiliets)
9. SLEEP! SLEEP! SLEEP!
10. Write purpose statements for all functions
11. Comment code throught
12. Think before using Internet suggetions
13. Read manuals for everything
14. Find partner, work together
15. Consult with higher up whenevrr yyou can about code logic
16. Stay positive
17. FOR C: deallocate memmory in the same scope!
18. EAT! EAT! EAT!
19. NEVER copy -> paste
